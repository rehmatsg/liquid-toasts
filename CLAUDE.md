# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## What this is

`liquid_toasts` is a Flutter **plugin** that renders premium, natively-drawn
toasts on an overlay above the Flutter app — springy entrance, per-position
vertical stacking, async loading toasts — with **no `BuildContext` required**
(the whole Dart API is static). Both platforms are implemented and behave
identically: iOS renders in SwiftUI with adaptive Liquid Glass; Android renders
in Jetpack Compose with an opaque adaptive surface (no blur/glass). The Dart
API and wire protocol are platform-neutral.

## Commands

Run Dart commands from the repo root; run the app from `example/`.

```bash
flutter analyze                         # lint (flutter_lints, see analysis_options.yaml)
flutter test                            # all Dart unit tests
flutter test test/liquid_toasts_test.dart                    # one file
flutter test --plain-name 'show serializes the toast'        # one test by name

cd example && flutter run               # run the demo app (needs an iOS device/sim)
cd example && flutter run -t lib/showcase.dart   # run the README recording harness
```

Native Swift code is built by the Flutter/Xcode toolchain when you run the
example; there is no standalone Swift build step. The iOS sources live as a
local Swift package under `ios/liquid_toasts/`.

### Example app caveat

The bundled `example/` depends on the plugin via a **path** dependency. Flutter's
Swift Package Manager integration derives the package identity from the project
**folder name**, so the local checkout folder must be `liquid_toasts` (matching
the Dart package name), **not** `liquid-toasts`. The GitHub repo is named
`liquid-toasts`; rename the folder if you re-clone. Consumers installing from
pub.dev are unaffected. CocoaPods is also supported (`ios/liquid_toasts.podspec`).

## Architecture

The plugin is a **two-layer bridge**: a context-free Dart engine that owns
caller-facing state, and a SwiftUI overlay on iOS that owns all rendering and
the actual toast stack. They communicate over a method channel (Dart→native
commands) and an event channel (native→Dart lifecycle events).

### Dart side (`lib/`)

- `ToastEngine` (`lib/src/toast_engine.dart`, internal singleton) — owns ALL
  state: the registry mapping toast id → `ToastRegistration` (dismissal
  `Completer`, action callback + `activeActionId`, `onTap`, `lastToast`,
  generation counter, per-toast op chain), the event subscription, the memoized
  handshake, and the config. Every platform operation for a toast runs on its
  registration's **FIFO op chain**, which is what lets `show` return a handle
  synchronously — an `update`/`dismiss` issued before the show acks just queues
  behind it. Op errors never escape to fire-and-forget callers (a failed show
  completes the handle `channelLost`). `dismissAll` chases in-flight shows with
  an idempotent per-id dismiss so no native toast is orphaned.
  **All user callbacks (action/tap) live here, never cross the wire** — native
  only echoes back ids, so a stale tap after an `update` swapped the action is
  dropped by comparing `activeActionId`; a replace/patch bumps the registration
  `generation`, which supersedes any in-flight `loadingOnPress` completion.
- `Toaster` / `toast` (`lib/src/toaster.dart`, exported) — the public API: a
  const callable object (`toast('hi')`, `toast.success(...)`,
  `toast.promise(...)`, `toast.raw(Toast)`), all delegating to the engine.
  Convenience toasts are constructed in exactly one place (`_semanticShow`),
  where omitted-vs-explicit-null duration is resolved
  (explicit > `LiquidToastsConfig.defaultDuration` > `SemanticDefaults`).
  A null `Toast.position` resolves to the config default in the engine.
- `LiquidToasts` (`lib/liquid_toasts.dart`) — the **deprecated** legacy facade;
  one-line delegates over the engine that keep the old contracts (its `show`
  awaits the platform ack via `engine.settle`). Removed at 1.0.
- `LiquidToastsPlatform` (`lib/liquid_toasts_platform_interface.dart`) — the
  `PlatformInterface` the engine talks to; swap `.instance` with a fake in tests.
- `MethodChannelLiquidToasts` (`lib/liquid_toasts_method_channel.dart`) — the iOS
  impl. Every command is wrapped in an `_envelope` carrying `protocolVersion`
  (currently `1`); bump it on incompatible wire changes.
- `lib/src/` — the wire models: `toast.dart` (`Toast` + `copyWith` + `toMap`;
  all constructors funnel through a canonical private `_raw` ctor),
  `semantic_defaults.dart` (the ONLY home of per-semantic duration/maxLines/
  haptic defaults), `toast_action.dart`, `toast_handle.dart` (patch-style
  `update(...)` + `replace(Toast)`), `loading_toast.dart` (deprecated),
  `toast_event.dart` (inbound events + `ToastDismissReason`), `toast_style.dart`,
  `toast_position.dart`, `liquid_toasts_config.dart`, `ids.dart` (id minting).

### iOS side (`ios/liquid_toasts/Sources/liquid_toasts/`)

- `LiquidToastsPlugin.swift` — the `FlutterPlugin`/`FlutterStreamHandler`. Decodes
  channel args into `ToastModel`s and drives the manager. Flutter calls channel
  handlers on the main thread, so it uses `MainActor.assumeIsolated` and touches
  UI directly with no actor hop.
- `ToastOverlayHost.swift` — singleton that installs a transparent
  `PassthroughHostView` + `UIHostingController` into the **same window** as
  Flutter content (so Liquid Glass can sample the live app behind it). The host
  hit-tests against `manager.frames` so touches pass through to Flutter except
  where a real toast sits. Installed eagerly at plugin registration so the first
  toast gets its entrance transition.
- `ToastManager.swift` — `@MainActor ObservableObject`, the single source of
  truth for the stack. Owns the queue, replace-by-`groupKey`, per-position
  `maxVisible` enforcement, exactly-once teardown, and emits lifecycle events
  via `onEvent`. **Publish surface is deliberately minimal**: `toasts` is the
  one SwiftUI input (runtime flags like `isActionBusy` live on the models);
  `frames` is intentionally NOT `@Published` (only the host's hit-test reads
  it, imperatively — publishing it would invalidate the whole container on
  every animation frame of a drag or spring); `stackGeneration` (plain var,
  bumped only when the id set changes) is the container's animation token.
- `DeadlineScheduler.swift` — owns ALL auto-dismiss timing: **wall-clock**
  deadlines (survive backgrounding), watcher tasks, pause-on-touch banking,
  and the background/foreground sweep. Timer state never touches the
  `@Published` array. Flutter-free by design.
- `ToastContainerView` — groups toasts by position; each row is an
  equality-gated `ToastRow` (`.equatable()`), so a change to one toast never
  re-renders its siblings. The container-level `.animation(motion, value:)`
  is **load-bearing**: it swaps the spring for `easeInOut` under Reduce Motion.
- `ToastView` — per-toast orchestrator: measurement-driven width/wrap state,
  glass surface, drag/tap/press gestures, accessibility.
- `ToastContentView` — the row (leading slot / text column / action button) +
  `AvatarSlot`/`AvatarView`/`CircularProgressView`.
- `ToastMeasurement.swift` — the two hidden off-screen probes (wrap decision +
  hugging width) behind an Equatable inputs struct; they only emit
  preferences, `ToastView` owns the handlers.
- `ToastMetrics.swift` — every shared layout constant + the springs. The
  probes must mirror the live layout's insets exactly; routing all values
  through here makes that lockstep structural. Change layout numbers HERE.
- `ToastImageDecoder.swift` — off-main image decode (+ downsampling of large
  sources). `ToastModel.expectsImage` reserves the avatar slot from the first
  frame so pixels landing later never shift the layout.
- `IconView` / `GlassBackground` / `ActionButton` — leaf views.
  `GlassBackground` picks real `glassEffect` (iOS 26+) vs `.ultraThinMaterial`
  (iOS 17–25) vs opaque (Reduce Transparency); those `#available` blocks are
  compile-time API gates — `Capabilities.swift` centralizes only the
  value-level checks (wire strings).
- `Models.swift` — `ToastModel` and friends (all `Equatable`; the image
  compares by identity via `ToastImage`); mirrors the Dart wire format.
- `WireDecoding.swift` — `[String: Any]` decode helpers (NSNumber-aware).
- `DynamicIslandGeometry.swift` — device geometry snapshot for `queryGeometry`.
- `Haptics.swift` — maps the toast's haptic enum to `UINotificationFeedbackGenerator`.

### Wire protocol invariants

When changing anything that crosses the channel, keep both sides in lockstep:

- **Enum/event strings are identical on both sides** by exact string match
  (e.g. dismiss reasons `timeout`/`manual`/`swipe`/`action`/`tap`/`replaced`/
  `dismissAll`/`appBackgrounded`; events `shown`/`actionTapped`/`tapped`/
  `dismissed`). `ToastEvent.fromMap` and `reasonFromWire` map them on the Dart side.
- **Ids are minted in Dart** (`ids.dart`): `lt_<sessionPrefix>_<counter>`. The
  `sessionPrefix` is random per isolate and sent in `handshake` (reserved wire
  data — native does not compare it). Native `flushAll`s **unconditionally on
  every handshake**, which is what clears stale toasts after a **hot restart**
  (the old Dart event sink is dead, so those toasts must be dropped silently).
- Command acks are maps: `show`→`{accepted}`, `update`→`{applied}`,
  `dismiss`→`{dismissed}`, `dismissAll`→`{dismissedIds}`. A `false`/missing ack is
  an expected race (toast already gone) — the facade reconciles by locally
  completing the handle so `onDismissed` never hangs.

### Promise / loading contract

`toast.promise<T>(future, ...)` (and the deprecated `showLoading`, both backed
by `ToastEngine.promiseWith`) shows a spinner, then morphs to success/error.
It **returns the future's value / rethrows its error** — the visual is
best-effort (skipped if the toast was already dismissed; a throwing builder is
logged and never corrupts the outcome) but the caller always owns the result.
Don't change this to swallow results. Promise specs (`loading`/`success`/
`error`) accept `String | Toast | builder` and are validated **eagerly** so
misuse throws `ArgumentError` at the call site.

## Testing notes

- Dart tests use the shared `FakeLiquidToastsPlatform` (`test/fake_platform.dart`)
  installed via `LiquidToastsPlatform.instance`, with manual control over the
  event stream, which ids native considers "live", an ordered `callLog`, and a
  `showGate` completer to simulate slow native acks (for in-flight-race tests).
- `toast.debugReset()` resets all engine state between tests;
  `toast.debugEmit(event)` injects a native event into the router. Both are
  `@visibleForTesting` — use them rather than reaching into private state.
  `ToastEngine.instance.settle(id)` (import `src/toast_engine.dart`) awaits a
  toast's queued platform ops — use it instead of pumping arbitrary delays.
- `test/toaster_test.dart` covers the new API; `test/legacy_facade_test.dart`
  is per-member smoke coverage of the deprecated facade (keep it green until
  the 1.0 removal).
- Native behaviors that unit tests can't reach have scripted simulator probes
  in `example/lib/`: `bg_probe_demo.dart` (wall-clock deadlines across
  backgrounding + hot-restart flush; drive it with `simctl` foreground/
  background cycles and read the `BGPROBE:` markers) and
  `render_probe_demo.dart` (render isolation; add a temporary NSLog to
  `ToastView.body` and count bodies per patch — expect ~1, not one per
  visible toast).

## Demo / showcase videos

`example/lib/showcase.dart` is the recording harness for the README's
`assets/showcase/*.mp4` clips (full-bleed wallpaper so glass has something to
refract, clean gaps between previews). The exact ffmpeg/simctl regeneration
recipe is documented in that file's header comment.

For ad-hoc demo videos (e.g. showing off a styling change), use the automated
recorder instead of doing it by hand:

```bash
tool/record_demo.sh --target lib/multiline_demo.dart --prefix MULTILINE --contact
```

It launches the example on a booted iOS sim, records a clean hot-restart replay,
and encodes a high-quality **60 fps** mp4 cropped to the toast zone (lead-in
auto-trimmed; `--contact` writes a verification grid). Write new reels with
`runDemoReel()` in `example/lib/demo_harness.dart` — a `name → preview` map that
emits the `<prefix>:…:START/END` + `<prefix>:DONE` markers the recorder keys off
(`example/lib/multiline_demo.dart` is the worked example). The `record-demo`
skill documents the full workflow. Note: the sim's display link caps capture at
60 fps; true 120 fps needs a physical ProMotion device. Toasts animate natively
in SwiftUI, so capture smoothness is independent of Flutter debug/profile mode.
